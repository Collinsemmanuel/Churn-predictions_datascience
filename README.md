Customer Churn Prediction Project

Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is a critical metric for any business, and being able to predict it can help companies take proactive measures to retain customers.


Data
The dataset used for this project contains information about customers, including their demographics, usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.



Methodology
The project uses Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The code is written in a Jupyter Notebook hosted on Google Colab.


Model Building
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict customer churn. The best performing model was selected based on its accuracy and other relevant metrics.


Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn.



How to Use
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or any other compatible environment.
    Run the cells in the notebook to see the code and results.

Future Work
In the future, we plan to explore additional features and experiment with different models to further improve the prediction accuracy.
